    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>From the 27th to the 30th of October 2025, the <a target="_blank" href="https://aims.ac.za">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)</a>, in Cape Town, South Africa, will host the <b>1st AIMS workshop and school on learning and testing in the quantum world</b>.</p>

    <p>The event will consist of both a workshop and school, with the workshop taking place in the mornings, and the school in the afternoons.  In particular, each morning will consist of long talks from invited workshop participants, aimed both at disseminating recent progress on quantum learning and testing, as well as formulating important questions and topics for future research. Each afternoon will then consist of tutorials on advanced topics in quantum learning and testing. These afternoon tutorials will be aimed at graduate students in the mathematical sciences with an existing introductory background in quantum computing, and a special interest in research on quantum learning and testing.</p>
    
    <p>Students of the school are both welcome and encouraged to attend morning workshop talks in order to gain exposure to the latest research on quantum and learning and testing. Workshop participants are encouraged to make use of the afternoons for collaborative discussion and research. Indeed, the school and workshop are colocated in order to give students of the school exposure to cutting edge research, and to allow workshop participants time and space (by the beach) for the development of new projects and collaborations.</p>
    
    

    <h2>Learning and Testing in a Quantum World</h2>

    <p>Both the workshop and school will focus on questions of learning and testing in the quantum world. On the one hand, this includes questions aimed at understanding the extent to which quantum algorithms can or cannot be used meaningfully for learning and testing <i>classical</i> objects, such as functions and distributions. Said informally - to what extent can we use quantum algorithms to gain meaningful advantages for machine learning and data analysis? On the other hand, this also includes questions related to the development of both classical and quantum algorithms for learning and testing quantum objects, such as states and channels, in a wide variety of learning models.</p>

    <h2>Application and Registration</h2>

    Workshop talks will be by invitation only. Applications for the school will open in June. Full funding will be available for selected school participants based in Africa.
